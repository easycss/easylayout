  <section>Normally Malcolm wouldn't care but his beard and hair were looking better than normal after several weeks of looking like a homeless yoga instructor, so when office temp Stacey told him he should consider more time grooming before waltzing in at 9.45am, he was suddenly consumed with a wave of self doubt. Today of all days was the worst time to feel such despair and perhaps if Stacey worked harder on her people skills and checked the Teams Calendar once in a while, she would have spoken with less venom. Malcom realised he was catatrophising and began his breathing and calming exercises. Deep breath in, you are the maker of your reactions. Long breath out, don't assume the worst, put a spin on negativity. Deep breath in, you are focused and calm....fuck!!!!, abruptly the exercise was terminated. Why did she have to say that before my meeting with Regional Accounting?</section>
